Command line tool for all tasks linting, fixing and more.

## Usage with Visual Studio Code

You might want to support auto formatting of supported file types in VSCode. To enable this add the "prettier" plugin to your installation and add these user settings:

```json
"prettier.eslintIntegration": true,
"prettier.stylelintIntegration": true,
```

There should be no need for any of the other settings as it most often makes more sense to use the central `.prettierrc.yml` for all of the different use cases.
